Overview
--------
MEAN is one of the fast growing full JavaScript stack. Many software companies are looking for developers with MEAN stack skills. MEAN is an acronym of MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node.js. These four are good enough for creating highly interactive, responsive and scalable web applications. Beauty of MEAN is in simplicity and single language (JavaScript) for complete application - frontend, backend, database and client server interactions (JSON). MEAN is giving heavy competition to the traditional server-side technologies like J2EE and .NET.
